# 🧠 CEH Practical Preparation Journey (Proof of Concept)

This repository documents my hands-on preparation for the **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) Practical** certification. The focus was on building real-world offensive security skills through simulations, labs, and tool-based exercises in ethical hacking.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To gain job-ready Red Team skills required for CEH Practical by working through structured lab exercises and mastering core penetration testing tools and techniques used by ethical hackers.

## 📜 Certification Goal

This learning path aligns with the **CEH Practical** exam objectives, focusing entirely on real-world simulations and hands-on hacking scenarios across:

1. Information Gathering  
2. Vulnerability Analysis  
3. Exploitation  
4. Post-Exploitation  
5. Reporting
